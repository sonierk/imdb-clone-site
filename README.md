# imdb-clone-website

repository - https://github.com/sonierk/imdb-clone-site.git

This project has some of the core funtions of the IMDB website, such as search, view details, save favorite movies.
This is part of the front end development skill test project.

In this app. we can search movies, view details of movies and add/remove fav movies to a favourite list.
The home page features the list of movies currently trending/now playing.

The tech. stack that I have used in this project is html, css and javascript.

I have used TMDB api for fetching movies data.
